## Development Setup

This project uses [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) to run quality checks
automatically as Git hooks. prek is a fast, dependency-free drop-in
replacement for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) written in Rust.

### Installing prek

Install prek using your preferred method:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| Homebrew (macOS/Linux) | `brew install prek` |
| uv | `uv tool install prek` |
| pip / pipx | `pip install prek` |
| Scoop (Windows) | `scoop install main/prek` |

See the [prek installation docs](https://prek.j178.dev/installation/) for
all options (Nix, conda, cargo, Docker, …).

### Installing the Git hooks

Once prek is installed, wire it into the repository's Git hooks:

```sh
prek install
```

This installs two hooks driven by `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

- **pre-commit** — runs [zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor)
  (GitHub Actions security linter) and the Maven unit tests on every
  `git commit`.
- **pre-push** — runs the Maven integration tests on every `git push`.
